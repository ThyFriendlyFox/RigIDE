# RigIDE - Mobile IDE

A high-performance mobile IDE for iOS and Android, inspired by VSCode and Cursor.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Flutter 3.19+** - Cross-platform UI framework with custom rendering
- **Dart** - Primary language for performance and productivity
- **Native Modules** - iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) for performance-critical operations
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** - Code intelligence and IntelliSense
- **Tree-sitter** - Fast incremental parsing for syntax highlighting
- **libgit2** - Native Git operations

### Performance Optimizations

- Custom text editor with efficient syntax highlighting
- Virtual scrolling for large files
- Incremental compilation and analysis
- Memory-efficient file handling
- Native file system access
- Background processing for code analysis

### Key Features (Planned)

- Multi-language support with LSP
- Git integration with visual diff
- Plugin/extension system
- Terminal emulator
- Project management
- Code completion and IntelliSense
- Debugging capabilities
- Cloud sync and collaboration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.19+
